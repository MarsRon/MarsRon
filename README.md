# uhhh what do i put here

Hi. I'm MarsRon, a young student from Malaysia aiming to become a better JavaScript developer.

I have experience with Discord.js bots, some Luau scripting in Roblox and more. I'm also interested in learning more programming languages such as the C family.

I'm a KonoSuba light novel lover and a casual anime watcher. I play Minecraft Bedrock Edition with my friends and I also enjoy Genshin Impact.

Oh yeah I have a semi functional blog at https://marsron.ml

## Projects

Most of my projects are on my GitHub, check it out [here](https://github.com/MarsRon?tab=repositories)!
